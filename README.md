# Sparsest-Cut-Solver
Implementation of a Sparsest Cut Solver in C. For my Bachelor's Thesis 'Fast Hierarchical Clustering on Structured Data', 2022

Implements Dasgupta's Heuristic introduced in:

**A cost function for similarity-based hierarchical clustering**    
*S. Dasgupta, 2016  
Proceedings of the Forty-Eighth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, STOC '16, page 118-127

With the heuristics' core being filled with a Sparsest Cut Solver based on:

**The complexity of finding uniform sparsest cuts in various graph classes.**
